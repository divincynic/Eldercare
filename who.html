            <hr>
            <h4>Mission</h4>
            <p>At Eldercare, our mission is to provide comprehensive support to seniors, addressing their technological challenges and offering assistance with various issues they may encounter, including housing insecurity and health concerns like Alzheimer's disease. We are dedicated to empowering seniors to navigate the digital world with confidence while also fostering a sense of community and support.</p>
            <h4>Values</h4>
            <p>Respect, proactiveness, and empathy are at the heart of everything we do. We believe in treating every senior with dignity and understanding, taking proactive steps to anticipate their needs, and approaching our work with compassion and empathy.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>Eldercare was founded in April 2024 by Harshavardhan Thorat and Naveed Islam, two passionate 9th-grade students at Whitney High School. Inspired by the challenges faced by seniors at the local Cerritos Senior Center, they embarked on a journey to make a meaningful difference in the lives of seniors in their community. Since our inception, we have remained committed to our mission of serving seniors and providing them with the support they deserve.</p>
            <span>
            <p>At Eldercare, we strive to be a beacon of hope and assistance for seniors, empowering them to live fulfilling lives and stay connected to the world around them.</p>
